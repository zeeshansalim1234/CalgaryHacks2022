## What is HealthPLug ?

HealthPLug is a one stop personalised platform that simplifies the concept of living a health lifestyle. Healthplug platform employs a machine learning model that generates videos, research papers, visualized data as a response to the users input. The Project stems from our personal hardships of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It is a mobile friendly web application which serves the needs of a user based on their input.
The platform is split into two main components.

## Challenges we ran into:
We ran into multiple challenges along the development phase and were dealt with accordingly. With respect to Front-End we had challenges with aligning of placeholders that were used to display the results from our Machine Learning model. With respect to Back-End we ran into time bounded challenges as Machine learning model takes a considerable amount of time to create the tensor file. Employing a Machine Learning model also posed as challenges as the packages to be downloaded were conflicting with existing packages, resolving dependies also required a lot of time dedication. Our API choice was another thing we struggled with as we wanted to ensure we were using the best and more reliable technologies with respect to development and debugging.

## API's used:
---
* Google Cloud Vision API
* IBM Watson speech to text API
* Youtube API
* Wikipedia API

---
## Integration of frameworks 
---
HealthPlug web application was developed as a React app. Available to be viewed on mobile as well. The Back-End aspect of the code consists of a Machine Learning Model, MySQL database, and Flask API.
Machine Learning model uses non textual input and provides relevant youtube suggestions, research papers, and more. HealthPLug is personalized for each user. The data pertaining to each user is stored in a MySQL database. The database also contains the search history of each user from previous interactions with the platform.
Flask API was used to act as a controller between the Machine Learning model, Database and Front-End
